# Hoard 🗃️

**Hoard** is a high-performance, in-memory caching library for Go, designed to handle high-throughput workloads with minimal latency. It features **sharding**, **LRU eviction**, and **time-to-live (TTL)** support, making it ideal for applications that require fast and efficient caching.

---

## Features ✨

- **Sharding**: Distributes cache data across multiple shards to reduce lock contention and improve performance.
- **LRU Eviction**: Automatically evicts the least recently used items when the cache reaches its capacity.
- **TTL Support**: Allows setting a time-to-live (TTL) for each cache item, ensuring stale data is automatically removed.
- **Thread-Safe**: Built with `sync.Map` and `sync.Mutex` to ensure safe concurrent access.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for low latency and high throughput, with benchmarks showing **500 ns/op for Fetch** and **1.5 µs/op for Store**.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and efficient memory usage.

## Installation 📦

To install `hoard`, use `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/mrkouhadi/hoard
```

---

## Usage 🚀

### Basic Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
	"github.com/mrkouhadi/hoard"
)

func main() {
	// create a cache with 5 shards, maximum of 10000 items per shard, and a cleanup interval of 10 seconds
	cache := hoard.NewCache(5, 10000, time.Second*10)

	// store some data
	cache.Store("name", "Aboubakr Kouhadi", time.Second*5)
	cache.Store("age", 33, time.Second*5)
	cache.Store("profession", "English Teacher", time.Second*5)
	cache.Store("hobbies", "playing Guitar and soccer, swimming, and coding", time.Second*5)

	// fetch all cached data
	data := cache.FetchAll()

	// fetch a single piece of data
	if value, exists, err := cache.Fetch("name"); exists {
		if err == nil {
			fmt.Println("Fetched name: ", value)
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Error fetching name: ", err)
		}
	} else {
		fmt.Println("age does not exist or has expired or deleted...")
	}

	// Update a piece of data
	err := cache.Update("name", "bryan bryan", time.Minute)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Update error:", err)
	}

	// Delete the value
	cache.Delete("profession")

	// clean up all data
	cache.CleanupAll()
}
```

## Performance 🚀

Hoard is optimized for **low latency** and **high throughput**. Here are the benchmark results on an **Apple M1**:

## Benchmarks

Here are the latest benchmark results for the caching library on **Apple M1**:
| Benchmark                         | Time per Operation | Memory Allocation | Allocations per Operation |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Store**                         | 902.9 ns/op        | 552 B/op          | 9 allocs/op               |
| **Fetch**                         | 762.7 ns/op        | 355 B/op          | 6 allocs/op               |
| **StoreAndFetch / Concurrent**    | 134.2 µs/op        | 19.47 KB/op       | 349 allocs/op             |
| **Iterate** 						| 1.364 ms/op        | 577 B/op          | 21 allocs/op              |
| **CleanupAll**                    | 422.8 ns/op        | 0 B/op            | 0 allocs/op               |


### Concurrent Access

Hoard is designed for concurrent use. You can safely call `Store`, `Fetch`, and `Delete` from multiple goroutines:

```go
go func() {
	cache.Store("key1", "value1", time.Second*10)
}()

go func() {
	value, exists, _ := cache.Fetch("key1")
	if exists {
		fmt.Println("Fetched value:", value)
	}
}()
```
